# Note
## Here are all the current config files I am running on my Voron V2.4. I am running a BigTreeTech Manta M8P board with the CB1 (I am not sure if my board was affected by the wifi bug). I have the printer setup with a Klicky Probe and you can find the info on how to install that on your printer here: https://github.com/protoloft/klipper_z_calibration (Thank you protoloft)
## I do not work for BigTreeTech nor do I offer support for their products so please if you are having issues contact them at the links below (But I will try to help IF I can).
## I am not a part of the Voron Dev Team and I will not offer support for them but you can get in touch with them at https://vorondesign.com/ or join their discord https://discord.gg/voron
